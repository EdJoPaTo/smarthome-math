# Smarthome Math

Personal collection of common math I use across different personal smart home projects such as lightings.

It is only meant to be used by me.
There is no versioning and only the main branch is used.

```toml
[dependencies.smarthome-math]
git = "https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/smarthome-math"
branch = "main"
```
